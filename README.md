This is the site that will be hosted on [cschuijt.nl](https://cschuijt.nl),
when it is done. It is a simple static site with Tailwind for CSS.

## How to use
 * `node install` to install Tailwind
 * `./watch.sh` to keep the compiler running as you edit HTML.

HTML and compiled CSS lives in the `/public` directory, pre-compiler
CSS in `/src`.
