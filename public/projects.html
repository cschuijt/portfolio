            <span class="text-white text-2xl font-bold">Gem of True Sight</span>
            is a Telegram bot that lets users sign in with Steam so that it can
            fetch their Dota 2 match data, statistics and profile data and display it
            in any chat on request. It is written in Rails and combines several
            APIs, like the OpenDota API, the Steam API and of course the
            Telegram bot API. It can cache and paginate API results, ask for
            clarification when a user's input is unclear and respond to inline
            queries to post into any chat, even when the bot itself is not
            there. It also has a fully featured test suite and CI/CD pipeline.
          </p>

            It is currently live at <a href="https://dotagem.net" class="text-teal-300 hover:text-teal-500 underline">dotagem.net</a>
            and on Telegram as <a href="https://t.me/dotagem_bot" class="text-teal-300 hover:text-teal-500 underline">@dotagem_bot</a>.
            The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/dotagem/dotagem" class="text-teal-300 hover:text-teal-500 underline">GitHub</a>.

            <span class="text-white text-2xl font-bold">Nightscout</span> is
            an open-source glucose monitoring system "in the cloud". While
            proprietary systems exist to upload data from flash glucose monitors
            to the internet, these didn't have the functionality or portability
            that I was looking for, so I took to hosting my own instead. In the
            process, I learned how to set up MongoDB, which runs on my own
            server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to my Nightscout instance is password-controlled (as it
            probably should be), but feel free to contact me if you would like
            a demonstration.
          </p>

            Although <span class="text-white text-2xl font-bold">webdesign</span>
            is not my strongest suit, I have been known to host and maintain
            simple, static websites for friends and family.
